Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet
This repository compares **ARIMA** and **Prophet** models on a time series dataset of prices, while factoring in **weekends** and **Indian national holidays**.
Features
Two robust approaches: ARIMA and Prophet
Auto-detection of weekends and public holidays
Log transform for stability and inverse transform for readable outputs
Forecasts saved as `.csv` files
Clean, modular code — just plug in your own CSV

## Why Prophet Wins (in this case)
No manual filtering — weekends and holidays handled natively
More dynamic and varied forecast values
Easier holiday customization

Both ARIMA and Prophet approaches included  
Data preprocessing, holiday detection, forecasting, and output export — all in one place
